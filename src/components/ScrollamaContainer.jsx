                that had helped stabilize this colossal ice formation for
                thousands of years.
                <br />
                <br />
                This subtle but profound shift would prove to be the beginning
                of an accelerating transformation, as the glacier's hold on its
                ancient foundation started to weaken, setting the stage for what
                scientists would later recognize as a dramatic acceleration in
                its retreat.

                    After witnessing these dramatic transformations, a crucial

                    ice tongue from below. As this floating extension of the
                    glacier thins and weakens, it becomes more vulnerable to
                    fracturing. Like removing a door from its hinges, the loss

                    these natural anchors, the glacier's movement toward the sea

                    water penetrates deeper beneath the glacier, it forces this
                    critical boundary to withdraw farther and farther. Each

                Drilling into the Unknown: Unexpected Findings Beneath Thwaites
              </AnimatedHeading>
              
              <p>
              <br />
                A breakthrough in late 2019 brought scientists closer than ever
                to Thwaites' hidden underside. British Antarctic Survey
                scientist Peter Davis and his team drilled through 600 meters of
                ice to reach the ocean waters near the glacier's grounding line.
                Using this borehole—located just two kilometers from where the
                glacier lifts off the seafloor—they gathered critical data about
                the glacier's interaction with ocean waters.
                <br />
                <br />
                The findings were surprising. Over nine months, while the waters
                grew warmer and saltier, the ice was melting at a rate of 2-5
                meters per year—slower than scientists had predicted in their
                models. This discovery revealed just how complex the dynamics
                beneath Thwaites really are.

                These groundbreaking measurements were part of an ambitious
                scientific endeavor: the MELT project. As part of the
                International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration—one of the largest
                international field campaigns ever undertaken in Antarctica—MELT
                brings together scientists from five universities and the
                British Antarctic Survey in a joint U.S.-U.K. effort to
                understand how warm waters are affecting Thwaites Glacier.

                The project's approach is as innovative as it is comprehensive.
                Scientists drill holes through 600 meters of solid ice using hot
                water drills—creating pathways to deploy their sophisticated
                instruments. Through these boreholes, they lower Icefin, a
                state-of-the-art underwater robot equipped with cameras and
                sensors, to explore the mysterious cavity beneath the glacier.
                This remote-controlled vehicle acts as scientists' eyes and ears
                under the ice, gathering crucial data about water temperature,
                salinity, and currents.

                Above the ice, researchers use specialized radar systems to
                measure how quickly the glacier is melting from below, while
                airborne surveys map the complex network of channels through
                which warm water might be reaching the glacier's vulnerable
                underbelly. Together, these measurements help scientists better
                predict how Thwaites might contribute to future sea level rise.

                — Peter Davis, in interview with NYU News
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Despite small amounts of melting, this finding offers no
                reassurance according to Davis's team. Even with less melting
                than predicted, the glacier continues its rapid retreat,
                suggesting that Thwaites is far more sensitive to climate change
                than previously understood. The glacier's delicate balance can
                be disrupted by even small changes in ocean temperature.
                <br />
                <br />
                The story became even more concerning in 2022. When David
                Holland, the lead U.S. principal investigator for the MELT
                project, led a team to western Thwaites, they made an alarming
                discovery. The melting rates they observed there were
                unprecedented—the highest ever recorded anywhere in
                Antarctica—suggesting that this section of the glacier may have
                already begun an irreversible retreat.

                In just over two decades, Thwaites has dramatically transformed.
                Its grounding zone, the crucial boundary where glacier meets
                seafloor, has pulled back more than eight miles—a retreat of 14
                kilometers that makes Thwaites one of Antarctica's
                fastest-changing glaciers.

                The situation is particularly alarming because much of Thwaites
                sits below sea level. This makes the glacier vulnerable to
                rapid, irreversible ice loss—a collapse that could raise global
                sea levels by more than half a meter within centuries.

                <br />
                <br />
                By 2030, Thwaites is expected to lose its crucial grip on the
